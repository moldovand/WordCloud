I am a Senior R&D and Product Manager that pinpoints that unique place where customer needs and emerging technologies intersect - and where sound business strategies are born.
 
My activities are focused on Smart Tech Innovations that combine "Technological Strengths" (AI, 3D Sensing, Robotics, Industrial Internet of Things, GIS Mapping) and "Business Needs" with applicability in business fields like Smart Industry, Smart Community, Factories of the Future.

I believe innovation requires an entrepreneurial mindset combined with the courage to push boundaries and break new ground. If your organisation is looking for ways to innovate their products, services and processes, let’s discuss how I can help your team to make that happen.
